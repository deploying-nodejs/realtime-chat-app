# Case Study - Realtime Chat app

This case study is a Nodejs application built on [Socket.io](https://socket.io) to enable realtime communication. This case study is a little different from the usual Node.js deployments, because it involves real time websocket communication. This application would require configuring Nginx to support websocket connections. The code from this repository is forked from the main socket io examples repository.
